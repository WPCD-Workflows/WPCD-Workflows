<p>The EUROfusion Project on Code Development for Integrated Modelling (WP-CD)
supports the achievement of the European Fusion Roadmap at Horizon 2020
goals, via the development of existing modelling codes with a particular
focus on integrated modelling. The primary objectives of WPCD are: 1.
Provide a suite of codes that can be validated on existing machines and
used for JT-60SA, ITER and DEMO predictions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>build on the existing modelling codes developed by the EUROfusion
Consortium members including the Integrated Modelling (EU-IM)
infrastructure, toolset and codes developed under the former EFDA ITM
Task Force,</li>
<li>add new physics to the existing models</li>
<li>couple codes into integrated workflows</li>
<li>optimize codes.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Specific ITER simulation work in support of ITER IO and F4E with
specified deliverables. WPCD operates under a work plan aiming to provide
in the long term a full suite of integrated simulation workflows,
incorporating core-edge-SOL/PFC coupling, first-principles models and
control elements. A central task is the development of the new modular
European Transport Simulator, ETS, which is being deployed to JET modelling
infrastructure for validation and application to experimental analysis. In
addition to code and workflow development, rigorous code verification is
also performed under WPCD, within the EU-IM framework; whereas validation
of the released integrated modelling workflows against the experiments is
performed under the rerelated Task Forces. <a class="reference external" href="https://users.euro-fusion.org/iterphysicswiki/index.php/Main_Page/">EUROfusion WPCD webpage</a>.
The EU-IM Team includes both EUROfusion WPCD and WPISA CPT contributors,
see <a class="reference external" href="http://www.euro-fusionscipub.org/eu-im/">EU-IM Team</a>. This list
reproduces the status of members in 2015 and is possibly not exhaustive.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-european-integrated-modelling-eu-im-approach">
<span id="world-itm-approach"></span><h2>The European Integrated Modelling (EU-IM) approach<a class="headerlink" href="#the-european-integrated-modelling-eu-im-approach" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The choice of Integrated Modelling made by the former EFDA ITM and
pursued now under EUROfusion WPCD is unique and original: it entails the
development of a comprehensive and completely generic tokamak simulator
including both the physics and the machine, which can be applied for any
fusion device. The simulation platform was designed to be fully modular,
flexible, and independent of a programming language.The choice of
modularity implies that each module contains a single physical model and
that the communication between the modules is standardised: a set of common
common rules (ontology) clearly specify the format of the data to be
consistently exchanged between modules (data-structure). The complexity of
coupling the codes together is therefore transferred to the definition of a
generic data-structure (allowing to describe and exchange information
concerning both physical quantities and technical objects, not assuming the
origin of those), extensible to allow the integration of new physics, as
well as more elaborate machine geometries and experimental data in the
future. A central project is the development of the so-called <strong>European
Transport Simulator (ETS)</strong> aimed to meet all the EU-IM requirements,
namely modularity, flexibility and standardized interfaces. In terms of the
physics, the ETS is designed to solve the standard set of one-dimensional
time dependent equations which describe the evolution of the core plasma.
The solver itself is designed with a modular approach enabling the
separation of the physics from the numerics, thereby facilitating the
testing/usage of the numerical schemes that best suit a particular physical
simulation.</p>

<div class="section" id="mission">
<span id="world-itm-mission"></span><h2>Mission<a class="headerlink" href="#mission" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The EU-IM operated under EFDA from 2004 until 2013. The main mission of
EU-IM was to provide a software infrastructure framework for EU
integrated modelling activities as well as a validated suite of
simulation codes for the modelling of present experiments, ITER and DEMO
plasmas. The EU-IM operated until 2013 under a work programme
formulated to support this goal, structuring the EU modelling effort
around existing experiments and ITER scenario prediction while
maintaining a long term strategic aim to provide a validated set of
European modelling tools for ITER exploitation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="achievements">
<span id="world-itm-achievements"></span><h2>Achievements<a class="headerlink" href="#achievements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>During the first phase of the EU-IM, surveys and cross-verification of the
available European models and numerical codes were performed within the
individual IMPs and the data-structure was extensively discussed and
defined. Equilibrium, linear MHD stability, core transport and RF wave
propagation, as well as the poloidal field systems and a few diagnostics
were the first topics addressed. Data structures have been finalised for
these and then expanded to address, among others, non-linear MHD, edge
physics, turbulence and neutral beam propagation. In parallel to the
development of the physics concepts, EU-IM developed the tools to
manipulate the data structure and use it in fully flexible and modular
simulation workflows. The EU-IM database contains machine descriptions from
JET, Tore Supra, MAST, FTU, FAST, AUG, ITER as well as some experimental
data from Tore Supra and JET. The EU-IM futher achieved the development of
the first release version of a fully modular and versatile simulator, the
ETS, with all the essential functionalities. The validation of the ETS
simualtor started in 2010 against the state-of-the-art transport codes and
ETS now starts to be used for the first physics applications. Next steps
are the validation of the simulator for a complete discharge on existing
experimental data with the available modules, the integration of more
quantitative physics models (&#8220;ab-initio&#8221;) and the integration of the whole
modelling of the device. Some posters that describe the EU-IM were presented
at an ITM EXPO at the 2011 EPS fusion conference in Strasbourg.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="structure">
<span id="world-itm-structure"></span><h2>Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#structure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The EFDA ITM was structured into four Integrated Modelling Projects
(IMPs) focusing on the following physics areas:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>IMP12</strong>
plasma equilibrium and MHD</li>
<li><strong>IMP3</strong>
transport code and whole discharge evolution</li>
<li><strong>IMP4</strong>
transport and micro-instabilities</li>
<li><strong>IMP5</strong>
heating, current drive (H&amp;CD) and fast particles</li>
</ul>
<p>The &#8220;Infrastructure and Software Integration Project&#8221; (<strong>ISIP</strong>) was in
charge of developing, maintaining and operating the code platform structure
and implementing the EU-IM data-structure. A key function of ISIP was to
provide infrastructure support to the IMPs. At present, under EUROfusion,
this expertise and tasks are ensured by the <strong>Core Programming Team</strong> under
the <strong>Infrastructure and Support Activities Work Package (WP-ISA CPT)</strong>.
Two further projects ensured the link with the experimentalists and the
provision of the experimental databases:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>AMNS</strong>
the &#8220;Atomic, Molecular, Nuclear Surface&#8221; Data</li>
<li><strong>EDRG</strong>
&#8220;Experimentalists and Diagnosticians Resource Group&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>The &#8220;ITER Scenario Modelling Working Group&#8221; (<strong>ISM</strong>) was established in
2007 as part of EU-IM with the aim to assist in systematic predictive
modelling of all ITER reference scenarios by using the major existing
integrated modelling tools, whilst the EU-IM code platform was in
development. ISM also supported the verification and validation of the ETS,
which aims to become the main tool for EU modelling activity.</p>

<p>Collaborative Development Environment (CDE)
A <strong>collaborative development
environment (CDE)</strong> is an online meeting space where a software development
project&#8217;s stakeholders can work together, no matter what timezone or region
they are in, to discuss, document , and produce project deliverables. The name was coined by <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grady_Booch">Grady Booch</a>.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Consistent Physical Object (CPO)</dt>
<dd>A Consistent Physical Object (CPO) is a
physics based, hierarchical data structure employed by the EU-IM for a
complete description of a physics area, e.g. equilibrium. All EU-IM code
modules interact through the exchange of CPOs. The CPOs also form the
basic block of data written to the EU-IM database.</dd>
<dt>Content Management System (CMS)</dt>
<dd><p class="first">A <strong>content management system (CMS)</strong> is
the collection of procedures used to manage work flow in a collaborative
environment. These procedures can be manual or computer-based. The
procedures are designed to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Allow for a large number of people to contribute to and share stored
data</li>
<li>Control access to data, based on user roles. User roles define what
information each user can view or edit</li>
<li>Aid in easy storage and retrieval of data</li>
<li>Reduce repetitive duplicate input</li>
<li>Improve the ease of report writing</li>
<li>Improve communication between usersq</li>
</ul>
<p class="last">In a CMS, data can be defined as nearly anything - documents, movies,
pictures, phone numbers, scientific data, etc. CMSs are frequently used
for storing, controlling, revising, semantically enriching, and
publishing documentation.</p>
</dd>
<dt>FC2K</dt>
<dd>FC2K is a tool for wrapping a Fortran or C++ source code into a Kepler
actor. Before using it, your physics code should be EU-IM-compliant (i.e.
use CPOs as input/output).</dd>

<dt>Universal Access Layer (UAL)</dt>
<dd>The UAL (Universal Access Layer) is a multi-language library that
allows exchanging Consistent Physical Objects (CPOs) between various
modules, and to write to an EU-IM database.</dd>
<dt>actor</dt>
<dd>Actors take execution instructions from a director. In other words,
actors specify what processing occurs while the director specifies
when it occurs. In the EU-IM, actors are usually modules which
contain physics codes like EQUAL or HELENA.</dd>
<dt>calibration</dt>
<dd>The process of adjusting numerical or physical modelling parameters
in the computational model for the purpose of improving agreement

<dt>data mapping</dt>
<dd>An XML file containing all the mapping essentials for mapping from a
local experimental database for a specific tokamak device to the EU-IM
database. The mapping essentials include for instance the download
method, local signal names, gains and offsets, time base, and
eventual interpolation option to ensure that only one time base is
set for each CPO that is built from multiple local signals. A java
code (exp2ITM developed under ISIP), with the MD and DM files as
inputs, is then run to connect to the local device database, retrieve
the required experimental data and populate the EU-IM database instance
for that shot/device and dataversion.</dd>

simulation that is not due to lack of knowledge.</dd>
<dt>kepler</dt>
<dd>Kepler is a software application for the analysis and modeling of
scientific data. Kepler simplifies the effort required to create
executable models by using a visual representation of these
processes. These representations, or &#8220;scientific workflows&#8221;, display
the flow of data among discrete analysis and modeling components.</dd>
<dt>machine description</dt>
<dd>The machine description (MD) of a device basically builds on the set
of engineering and diagnostic settings characterising a tokamak
device. This includes, for instance, the vessel/limiter description,
the PF coils and circuiting and lines of sight of diagnostics. In
practice, all MD information is encapsulated in an XML file that
emanates from the MD tagged datastructure schemas. An MD instance of
a given device is then stored into the EU-IM database as shot 0 for
that device database.</dd>
