<p>The EUROfusion Project on Code Development for Integrated Modelling (WP-CD)
supports the achievement of the European Fusion Roadmap at Horizon 2020
goals, via the development of existing modelling codes with a particular
focus on integrated modelling.
The primary objectives of WPCD are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Provide a suite of codes that can be validated on existing Tokamaks and
used for JT-60SA, ITER and DEMO predictions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>build on the existing modelling codes developed by the EUROfusion
Consortium members including the Integrated Modelling (EU-IM)
infrastructure, toolset and codes developed under the former EFDA ITM
Task Force,</p></li>
<li><p>add new physics to the existing models</p></li>
<li><p>couple codes into integrated workflows</p></li>
<li><p>optimize codes.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Specific ITER simulation work in support of ITER IO and F4E with
specified deliverables.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>WPCD operates under a work plan aiming to provide in the long term a full
suite of integrated simulation workflows, incorporating core-edge-SOL/PFC
coupling, first-principles models and control elements. A central task is
the development of the modular European Transport Simulator, ETS, which is
being deployed to JET and MST modelling infrastructures for validation and
application to experimental analysis.</p>
<p>In addition to code and workflow development, rigorous code verification is
also performed under WPCD, within the EU-IM framework; whereas validation
of the released integrated modelling workflows against the experiments is
performed under WPJET1 and WPMST1.</p>
<p>The Work Package is run as a project and managed by a project leader (M.
Romanelli, UKAEA, <a class="reference external" href="mailto:michele&#46;romanelli&#37;&#52;&#48;ukaea&#46;uk">michele<span>&#46;</span>romanelli<span>&#64;</span>ukaea<span>&#46;</span>uk</a>)</p>
<p>In 2019 the structure of the project has been reviewed and changed.</p>
<p>The project is now organised into three coordinated areas or subprojects
reflecting the present priorities: Enabling Workflow Exploitation, Workflow
Development, Workflow adaptation to IMAS. The Enabling Workflow
Exploitation Area (EWE) will coordinate the development of pre-processing
tools for the routine use of ETS and the equilibrium-MHD-stability workflow
in EUROfusion facilities, the development of visualization tools, synthetic
diagnostics and the provision of training to users. The Workflow
Development Area or subproject will coordinate the continuous development
of existing and new workflows in IMAS addressing specific modelling needs
of the other EUROfusion work packages. The Workflow adaptation to IMAS Area
will operate in strong collaboration with ITER IO and will ensure the
complete adaptation of existing workflows to IMAS using the most updated
Data Dictionary.</p>

<span id="eu-im-approach"></span><h2>1.1. The European Integrated Modelling (EU-IM) approach<a class="headerlink" href="#the-european-integrated-modelling-eu-im-approach" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The choice of Integrated Modelling made by the former EFDA ITM and
pursued now under EUROfusion WPCD is unique and original: it entails the
development of a comprehensive and completely generic tokamak simulator
including both the physics and the machine, which can be applied for any
fusion device. The simulation platform was designed to be fully modular,
flexible, and independent of a programming language.The choice of
modularity implies that each module contains a single physical model and
that the communication between the modules is standardised: a set of common
common rules (ontology) clearly specify the format of the data to be
consistently exchanged between modules (data-structure). The complexity of
coupling the codes together is therefore transferred to the definition of a
generic data-structure (allowing to describe and exchange information
concerning both physical quantities and technical objects, not assuming the
origin of those), extensible to allow the integration of new physics, as
well as more elaborate machine geometries and experimental data in the
future. A central project is the development of the so-called <strong>European
Transport Simulator (ETS)</strong> aimed to meet all the EU-IM requirements,
namely modularity, flexibility and standardized interfaces. In terms of the
physics, the ETS is designed to solve the standard set of one-dimensional
time dependent equations which describe the evolution of the core plasma.
The solver itself is designed with a modular approach enabling the
separation of the physics from the numerics, thereby facilitating the
testing/usage of the numerical schemes that best suit a particular physical
simulation.</p>

<div class="section" id="mission">
<span id="world-itm-mission"></span><h2>1.2. Mission<a class="headerlink" href="#mission" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The European Integrated Tokamak Modelling Task Force (ITM-TF) operated under EFDA from 2004 until 2013.
The main mission of the ITM TF was to provide a software infrastructure framework for EU
integrated modelling activities (EU-IM) as well as a validated suite of
simulation codes for the modelling of present experiments, ITER and DEMO
plasmas. The ITM TF operated until 2013 under a work programme
formulated to support this goal, structuring the EU modelling effort
around existing experiments and ITER scenario prediction while
maintaining a long term strategic aim to provide a validated set of
European modelling tools for ITER exploitation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="achievements">
<span id="world-itm-achievements"></span><h2>1.3. Achievements<a class="headerlink" href="#achievements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>During the first phase of the EU-IM effort, surveys and cross-verification of the
available European models and numerical codes were performed within the
individual integrated modelling projects and the data-structure was extensively discussed and
defined. Equilibrium, linear MHD stability, core transport and RF wave
propagation, as well as the poloidal field systems and a few diagnostics
were the first topics addressed. Data structures were finalised for
these and then expanded to address, among others, non-linear MHD, edge
physics, turbulence and neutral beam propagation. In parallel to the
development of the physics concepts, the EU-IM effort developed the tools to
manipulate the data structure and use it in fully flexible and modular
simulation workflows. The EU-IM database contains machine descriptions from
JET, Tore Supra, MAST, (as well as FTU, FAST), AUG, ITER, JT-60SA as well as some experimental
data from Tore Supra (WEST) and JET.
The EU-IM futher achieved the development of the first release version of a fully modular and versatile transport simulator, the
ETS, with all the essential functionalities. The validation of the ETS
simulator first started in 2010 against the state-of-the-art transport codes and
ETS recently started to be used for the first physics applications.
Next steps are the validation of the simulator for a complete discharge on existing
experimental data with the available modules, the integration of more
quantitative physics models (“ab-initio”) and the integration of the whole
modelling of the device.</p>
<p>The EU-IM effort was pursued under the EUROfusion project WPCD, progressing towards the achievement of a main milestone, “Extended Core Transport simulator used for analysis of JET1 and MST1 campaigns and developing facilities”.
The other achievements are listed below:
1.      An high-resolution equilibrium and linear MHD stability chain, for core and pedestal, applicable to  peeling-ballooning type instabilities has been released for the analysis of equilibria from any tokamak integrated in the EU-IM platform, including ITER and DEMO. A predictive J-alpha MHD pedestal stability analysis workflow has also been developed and is in test release stage.
2.      The fixed boundary core European Transport Simulator ETS, with various equilibrium modules and a full hierarchy of transport models, impurities, pellets, neutrals, sawteeth, Neoclassical Tearing Modes (NTM) modules, and full integration of Heating and Current Drive  sources (Electron Cyclotron, Neutral Beam Injection, Ion Cyclotron, alpha), including synergies has been released.The released ETS workflow has been implemented in JET modelling infrastructure and went through validation.
3.      A feedback controlled free boundary transport simulator prototype is operational and under verification.
4.      A Scrape-Off-Layer (SOL) turbulence workflow including a synthetic probe, directly reading from experimental database has been developed and applied to analyse ASDEX-Upgrade divertor power deposition.
5.      Benchmarks of EC, IC  and NBI codes within the EU-IM infrastructure were carried out on identified test cases and presented in conference (Topical Conference on Radiofrequency Power in Plasmas, EPS, IAEA Technical Meeting on Energetic Particles (EP)).
7.      Prototypes of self-consistent coupling between core and edge transport codes were demonstrated, in particular automated direct coupling of the ETS core transport code to the 2D edge transport code SOLPS.
8.      SOLPS technical optimization studies (parareal algorithm, speed-up techniques, reduced physics models) provided an assessment of speed-up techniques to be possibly integrated in SOLPS-ITER.
9.      A prototype acyclic workflow for modelling the SOL and interaction with Plasma Facing Components (PFC) was demonstrated by coupling the 2D transport code SOPLS to the 3D Monte Carlo PWI and impurity transport code ERO.</p>
