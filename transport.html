<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In conventional transport modelling, all quantities appearing in the
equations are 1-D, in some radial coordinate (poloidal flux, normalised
radius, etc). In general any monotonic radial coordinate is acceptable.
In the TF-EU-IM, the toroidal flux radius is standard. All we need from
the radial coordinate is the transformation to get to \( V, \) the
volume enclosed by the flux surface, which is fundamental to the
governing equations, which are conservation laws.</p>
<p>What we have to do is to take a measured result, which is a
time-averaged fluctuation-based transport flux and turn it into 1-D
quantities suitable to modelling. This is done using the flux surface
average, explained in conventions. The transport equations themselves
constitute a mean field approximation to the 3-D conservation laws. For
the fundamentals encountered in transport modelling see R Hazeltine and
J Meiss, Plasma Confinement (Addison-Wesley, 1992) chapter 8. For the
special properties of transport driven by small-scale pressure driven
ExB microturbulence see B Scott, &#8220;The character of transport caused by
ExB drift turbulence,&#8221; Phys Plasmas 10 (2003) 963-976.</p>
<p>For ambipolarity we follow the rules for dynamical alignment, which
follows the physics of how electron fluctuations determine the ExB
velocity fluctuations, which then advect all species. Magnetic flutter
nonlinearities act independently of this, but in our modelling they are
used solely for heat fluxes since the averaged particle transport due to
magnetic flutter and the current cancels, leaving the parallel ion
velocity which we neglect for this purpose. The reference for dynamical
alignment is B Scott, &#8220;Dynamical alignment in three species tokamak edge
turbulence,&#8221; Phys Plasmas 12 (2005) 082305.</p>
<p>Note: there are now auxiliary actors provided for this purpose: IMP4DV,
which does the D/V conversion and enforces ambipolarity assuming absence
of impurities, and IMP4imp, which subsequently enforces ambipolarity for
the set of main ion and impurity species. The IMP4DV actor should be
invoked directly after the transport model actor in the workflow chain,
if the model produces only fluxes or if the coefficients have to be
modified with the flux given. Ambipolarity is done using IMP4imp if the
coreimpurity CPO is used in the workflow. These auxiliary actors are
described on the <a class="reference external" href="#imp4_aux_actors">auxiliary actors page.</a></p>

<div class="section" id="particle-flux-as-an-example">
<h2>Particle Flux as an Example<a class="headerlink" href="#particle-flux-as-an-example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The mean field equation governing particle balance is the transport
equation for electrons,</p>
<div class="math">
\[{\partial \over \partial t} \langle n \rangle + \langle \vec \nabla \cdot \widetilde n \vec {\widetilde v}_E \rangle = S\]</div>
<p>in which the tilde symbol over the n and v denotes fluctuating quantities
and we neglect all transport processes except ExB eddy diffusion. The ExB
velocity is given by</p>
<div class="math">
\[\vec v_E = {c \over B^2} \vec B \times \vec \nabla \phi\]</div>
<p>where \( \phi \) is the electrostatic potential.</p>
<p>The angle brackets denote the flux surface average, and we will use the
property that the flux surface average of a divergence of a vector is
the volume derivative of the flux surface average of a contravariant
volume component of the vector, in this case</p>
<div class="math">
\[\langle \vec \nabla \cdot \vec \Gamma \rangle = {\partial \over \partial V} \langle \Gamma^V \rangle\]</div>
<p>where \( \Gamma \) is the particle flux whose flux-surface averaged volume component is</p>
<div class="math">
\[\langle \Gamma^V \rangle = \langle \widetilde n \widetilde v_E^V \rangle\]</div>
<p>This is converted to expression in terms of the radial coordinate \(
\rho \) using the fact that both \( V \) and \( \rho \) are flux
quantities whose gradients are parallel to each other. We have</p>
<div class="math">
\[{\partial \over \partial V} = {1 \over V'_\rho}{\partial \over \partial \rho}\qquad \Gamma^\rho = {1\over V'_\rho}\Gamma^V \qquad V'_\rho = {\partial V \over\partial \rho} \qquad g^{VV} = (V'_\rho)^2 g^{\rho\rho}\]</div>
<p>so we can write the transport equation as</p>
<div class="math">
\[{\partial n \over \partial t}+{1 \over V'_\rho}{\partial \over \partial \rho}V'_\rho \langle \Gamma^\rho \rangle = S,\]</div>
<p>where we have replaced \( \langle n \rangle \) with \( n \) following the assumptions of the 1-D version of mean field transport theory.</p>
<p>With all quantities now expressed in terms of flux quantities, we are
free to characterise the transport flux \( \langle \Gamma^\rho \rangle
\) in an arbitrary way, so long as only flux quantities appear. The
flux expansion within the flux surface as well as expansion or
contraction of surfaces of constant \( \rho \) is treated using the
metric coefficient \( g^{ \rho \rho} \) which is dimensionless. This way
we can characterise transport in terms of an effective diffusivity and
an effective frictional slip velocity which are given in SI units. By
convention both of these are done solely via \( g^{ \rho \rho} \) for
convenience, also reflecting that the effective velocity is actually
marking off-diagonal diffusive elements. Our convention for this follows
the ETS code and is given by</p>
<div class="math">
\[\langle \Gamma^\rho \rangle = \langle g^{\rho \rho} \rangle \left( n V_{{\rm eff}} - D_{{\rm eff}}{\partial n\over \partial \rho} \right)\]</div>
<p>So despite the special spatial distribution of any particular transport
process (ie, the underlying instability or nonlinear free energy access),
the flux-surface averaged flux itself and its expression in terms of
diffusion and frictional slip are identical characterisations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="metric-coefficients">
<h2>Metric Coefficients<a class="headerlink" href="#metric-coefficients" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Transport modellers want the Ds and Vs as physical quantities in SI
units. In general the fluxes are (magnetic) flux surface averaged
quantities, which implies the existence of metric elements in the
conversion. In our case we need \( \langle g^{\rho \rho} \rangle \)
where \( \rho \) is the toroidal flux radius in meters, so the metric
elements are dimensionless. In the equilibrium CPO, this is gm3 under
equilibrium%profiles_1d in the structure.</p>
<p>Note this is different from the ASTRA code which casts the Vs as proper
velocities, i.e., with one factor of grad-rho given by \( \langle
\sqrt{g^{\rho \rho}} \rangle \) which is gm7 under
equilibrium%profiles_1d in the structure. The units are the same and the
informational content is the same, but this difference has to be taken
into account in any transport modelling and benchmarking.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="heat-fluxes">
<h2>Heat Fluxes<a class="headerlink" href="#heat-fluxes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The heat flux is treated in a similar way, with transport equation</p>
<div class="math">
\[{3 \over 2}{\partial p_e \over \partial t} +{1 \over V'_\rho}{\partial \over \partial \rho} V'_\rho \langle q_e^\rho \rangle = Q_e + \sum_{{\rm ions}}T_{ei},\]</div>
<p>for electrons, with \( T_{ei} \) giving the species transfer and \( Q_e
\) the source. For ExB transport the heat flux has a advective (also
called convective) and a conductive piece given by</p>
<div class="math">
\[q_E = q_E{}_{{\rm cond}} + (3/2) T \Gamma_E\]</div>
<p>which appears with a 3/2 due to the Poynting cancellation. For
magnetic flutter transport the advective piece appears with the usual
factor,</p>
<div class="math">
\[q_m = q_m{}_{{\rm cond}} + (5/2) T \Gamma_m\]</div>
<p>Here the forms are given for each species and \( E \) and \( m \) refer
to the ExB eddy and magnetic flutter channels, respectively. For reasons
given below we are neglecting the magnetic flutter piece \( \Gamma_m \)
for the time being, and then the flutter piece merely adds to the heat
diffusivity.</p>
<p>The forms of these due to the fluctuations are then</p>
<div class="math">
\[\langle q^\rho \rangle = (3/2) \langle \widetilde p \widetilde v_E^\rho \rangle + \langle \widetilde q_\parallel \widetilde b^\rho \rangle\]</div>
<p>which breaks into advective and conductive pieces according to linearisation
of the pressure fluctuations</p>
<div class="math">
\[\langle q_{{\rm cond}}^\rho\rangle = (3/2) n \langle \widetilde T \widetilde v_E^\rho\rangle + \langle \widetilde q_\parallel \widetilde b^\rho\rangle \qquad\qquad \langle q_{{\rm adv}}^\rho \rangle = (3/2)T \Gamma = (3/2)T\langle\widetilde n \widetilde v_E^\rho \rangle\]</div>
<p>hence the density fluctuation piece is accounted for by the particle flux.
Neglect of the magnetic flutter advective piece (and particle flux) is the
same as neglect of the \( {\widetilde u_\parallel} {\widetilde b^ \rho} \) nonlinearity (in the delivery of the results, not in the turbulence
computations themselves).</p>
<p>The total conductive flux is then represented by</p>
<div class="math">
\[\langle q_{{\rm cond}}^\rho \rangle = \langle g^{\rho \rho} \rangle \left( nTY_{{\rm eff}} - n \chi_{{\rm eff}}{\partial T \over \partial \rho} \right)\]</div>
<p>with \( \chi \) and \( Y \) giving the heat diffusion and frictional
slip pieces for each species, respectively (these are in diff_eff and
vconv_eff in the CPO for each quantity).</p>
<p>Operationally, the turbulence module communicates the diff_eff and
vconv_eff due to each transport channel for each species to the
transport solver, and the metric coefficients are used by both modules.
The two modules can be on arbitrarily different grids, which communicate
through standard interpolation. This despite the fact that transport at
the micro-level is angle dependent (in general, it can be 3-D in the
time average if the sources are 3-D). The effective transport is 1-D so
long as parallel sound transit within the flux surface remains fast
compared to the local transport time. This breaks down anyway in the
edge, so the fact that the volume is a problematic coordinate and the
flux surface average is a problematic operation on open field lines
doesn&#8217;t enter.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ds-and-vs-from-turbulence-codes-to-transport-solvers">
<h2>Ds and Vs from Turbulence Codes to Transport Solvers<a class="headerlink" href="#ds-and-vs-from-turbulence-codes-to-transport-solvers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To serve the results from turbulence codes to transport solvers, we have
to turn the fluxes (results) into diffusivities and effective velocities
(coefficients, Ds and Vs for short), which represent more information
than is at hand. Transport solvers must work with Ds and Vs because they
use implicit schemes. The matrix must be diagonally dominant; hence one
cannot simply use the Vs. Fluxes which are zero and/or negative should
be given with positive diffusivities for the solvers to work. We need a
set of rules to provide this.</p>
<p>Considering the particle and heat transport fluxes for a given species,
we convert the gradient in to a logarithmic derivative and express the
flux in terms of a specific flux, which has units of velocity,</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}F &amp;= {1 \over n} \langle g^{\rho\rho}\rangle^{-1} \langle \Gamma^\rho \rangle= V_{{\rm eff}} - D_{{\rm eff}}{\partial \log n \over \partial \rho}
\\G &amp;= {1 \over nT} \langle g^{\rho \rho} \rangle^{-1} \langle q^\rho_{{\rm cond}}\rangle = Y_{{\rm eff}} - \chi_{{\rm eff}}{\partial \log T \over \partial \rho}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>wherein the conductive part of the heat flux (without the \( 3 \Gamma / 2 \) enters.</p>
<p>The choice of what to do with the Ds and Vs is somewhat arbitrary. The
needs of implicit transport solvers is for a positive D regardless of
the value or sign of either flux. We decide this by putting a limit on
the effective Prandtl number or its inverse: the larger specific flux is
taken to be entirely diffusive, with the effective velocity set to zero.
Furthermore, to address cases with very small or negative gradients, we
use proxy variables for the scale lengths to calculate the provisional
diffusivities before using the Prandtl number limitation to turn these
into actual diffusivities. Finally, the rest of the flux is asigned to
the effective velocity, so that the D and V formula reflects the actual
specific flux.</p>
<p>The Prandtl number limitation is expressed as follows. If the smaller
specific flux is within a factor of 5 of the larger, then both are
purely diffusive and the effective velocities are both zero. If not,
then the D ratio is set to 5, with the result that the smaller D, having
been corrected, is accompanied by the corresponding V, which is now
nonzero. The specific flux with the larger D will be returned with a V
which is zero.</p>
<p>The rationale is that the turbulent mixing by the ExB velocity affects
all processes, but that linear forcing can shift the average phase shift
of the fluctuations such that the effective flux can be small or
negative. The simplest example is adiabatic electrons, for which the ion
heat flux is robust but the particle flux is zero. In most situations
the specific heat flux will be the larger, and hence the familiar
situation is that of a D and V for the particle flux but a D (the chi)
only for the conductive heat flux.</p>
<p>The full algorithm starting with the specific fluxes appears as</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}L_n^{-1} = \max \left( {1 \over R}, \left \vert {\partial \log n \over \partial \rho} \right \vert \right) \qquad \qquad L_T^{-1} = \max \left( {1 \over R},\left \vert {\partial \log T \over \partial \rho} \right \vert \right) \\ \\ D' =\left \vert F \right \vert L_n \qquad \qquad \chi' = \left \vert G \right \vert L_T \\ \\ D = \max \left( D', {1\over 5} \chi' \right) \qquad \qquad \chi = \max\left ( \chi', {1 \over 5} D' \right) \\ \\ V = \left( F + D {\partial \log n \over \partial \rho} \right) \qquad \qquad Y = \left( G + \chi {\partial \log T \over \partial \rho} \right)\end{split}\]</div>
<p>and all four elements are set. Note that the channels are done in parallel
except for the Prandtl correction, in which the Max&#8217;s are taken
sequentially. For the provisional diffusivities, absolute values are used
to ensure positive values which are needed by transport solvers.</p>
<p>Note how in the end the actual gradients are used. If the gradients are
moderate then their actual values are used, and if the Prandtl
correction is not invoked, then both channels are diagonal. In any case
the full relation is used to get the effective velocities (V and Y) so
having set the rules to handle the arbitrariness of the diffusivities (D
and chi) to guarantee reasonable diagonal dominance in a transport
solver, the D&#8217;s and V&#8217;s agree with the fluxes themselves.</p>
<p>If there are more than two specific fluxes per species to consider, then
we treat each scale length separately as above and use N-way maxima in
the Prandtl correction for the N channels.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ambipolarity">
<h2>Ambipolarity<a class="headerlink" href="#ambipolarity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There remains the issue of ambipolarity of the D and V for particle
flux. For a pure singly charged plasma the ion and electron Ds and Vs
should be equal. Even if the turbulence model is gyrokinetic or
gyrofluid, in which case the gyrocenter charge density is not zero but
is equal to the generalised vorticity (polarisation), the quantities
given to a transport solver should follow the rules for a fluid
representation. However, transport modelling usually applies
ambipolarity rules to the electrons after computing the ions, while the
action of turbulence is actually the other way around: Dynamical
alignment refers to the process by which (1) electron parallel dynamics
controls the electrostatic fluctuations, then (2) the resulting ExB
velocity advects all species equally. So we correct the particle fluxes
by assuming the electrons determine the D according to the above
procedure and then (1) the fluctuations in the flux-inducing part of the
spectrum for the logarithmic densities are the same, and (2) the D&#8217;s are
the same. Then the V&#8217;s are solved for again, by taking</p>
<div class="math">
\[D_z = D_e = D \qquad \qquad V_z = V_e + D {\partial \log b_z \over \partial \rho} \qquad \qquad b_z = n_z/n_e\]</div>
<p>This is better than the transport modelling convention but will give them
the same information in a different way, and they will compute ambipolar
particle fluxes (radial transport of charge is zero).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="statistical-character">
<h2>Statistical Character<a class="headerlink" href="#statistical-character" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Turbulence has a statistical character, so convergence to a mean is not
monotonic and when within one std dev of the mean there is no further
convergence. The diffusivity for ExB turbulence is comparable to</p>
<div class="math">
\[D_E = \left. \langle (\widetilde v_E)^2 \rangle \right / \langle (\varpi)^2 \rangle^{1/2} \qquad \qquad \varpi_E = {c \over B} \nabla_\perp^2 \widetilde \phi\]</div>
<p>where \( \varpi_E \) is the ExB vorticity fluctuation, and these angle
brackets denote the ensemble average. To get an ensemble average over a
statistical quantity in practice, one must do some sort of finite-time
running averaging.</p>
<p>For transport modelling, the transport coefficients derived from a
turbulence code should always be given in terms of <a class="reference external" href="#imp4_averages">running exponential
averages.</a></p>
